# Azure Monitoring Policies

This will generate Azure policies in number of formats, or can simply be used to get a list of all reouces that support diagnostic settings along with the supported diagnostic settings for your own use. This tool provides policies for all resources that are mentioned in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs-categories) that have monitoring enabled.
